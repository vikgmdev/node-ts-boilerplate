### Installation

After installing the prerequisites, open a terminal and follow the next steps to
install the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/vikgmdev/node-ts-boilerplate.git
   ```

1. Move into the newly created folder:

   ```shell
   cd node-ts-boilerplate
   ```

1. Install the project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

1. [Optional] Create a local `.env` file. This can be used to point the server and set local variables.

   To use `.env.sample` as a starting place, you can copy it to `.env` with the following command:

   ```shell
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

1. Start the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

### Run the Project

To run the project, open a terminal and start the project in one of
the following modes:

- **Development mode**. Run this while developing. It auto-updates the
  application as you make changes in the code. To run the project in
  development mode, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm start
  ```

- **Production mode**. To run the project in production
  mode, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm run compile
  node dist/server/index.js
  ```

- **Docker container**. To create a docker container and run your project, use
  the following command:

  ```shell
  make dc-start
  ```

To verify that the project is running, open a web browser and enter the
following URL in the address bar:

```txt
http://localhost:4000
```

The following message appears:

## Debugging

To run the project in a way that allows an inspector to be attached to the process, execute the following command:

```shell
npm run start-debug
```

For [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), use the following `.vscode/launch.json` file to enable debugging directly from your editor:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach to Process",
      "processId": "${command:PickProcess}",
      "restart": true,
      "protocol": "inspector"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```shell
npm test
```
